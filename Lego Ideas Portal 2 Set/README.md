# Description
This is a (partial) re-creation of the lego ideas portal 2 set in stud.io

# Notes
* Beware that the since 27965 isn't flexible in stud.io, it's a seperate item which you'll need to connect manually
* Beware that since 73590c02b doesn't exist in stud.io, 73590c02a is used instead, the `bricklink parts.xml` has been modified to use the original
* I didn't create the original lego ideas model, I just recreated it in stud.io
